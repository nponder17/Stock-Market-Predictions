# Stock-Market-Predictions
This project utilizes machine learning techniques, including **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Pandas**, to predict stock prices. The model attempts to forecast the next day's price and determine whether the price will go up or down. The data used for this project is sourced from a CSV file, which is processed and cleaned using various data manipulation techniques.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and various technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD) are computed for better prediction accuracy.
- **Model Training**: TensorFlow's LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network is used to predict the next day's stock price. The model also performs binary classification to predict whether the price will increase or decrease.
- **Data Visualization**: Various visualizations are included to help with data analysis and model evaluation, such as plotting moving averages and the correlation matrix.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Accuracy metrics, with results for both price prediction and binary classification.
  
## Project Structure

- **`stockMarket.csv`**: The CSV file containing the stock market data, including columns like Date, Stock Price, and Volume.
- **`main.py`**: The main script that reads the data, processes it, computes necessary features, and trains the machine learning models.
- **`modelStructure.png`**: Visualization of the model architecture (generated by Keras' `plot_model` function).

## Key Functions

- **`readFile(fileName)`**: Reads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **`sortData(stockDataFrame)`**: Sorts the data by date for proper time series analysis.
- **`computeMovingAverage(stockDataFrame)`**: Calculates moving averages for different time windows.
- **`getTensorFlowPredictions(allFeatures)`**: Uses a TensorFlow LSTM model to predict stock prices based on historical data.
- **`checkFeatureCorrelation()`**: Creates a correlation matrix to evaluate relationships between features.
